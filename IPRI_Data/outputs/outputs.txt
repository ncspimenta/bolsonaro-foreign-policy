SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Main Research Questions:


1. How did Brazilian public opinion vary during weeks marked by Bolsonaro’s key foreign policy actions in 2022?

2. Was foreign policy used as an electoral tool in a polarized political environment?



Key Results:

- **Public Opinion Trends (H1):** Sentiment analysis of weekly survey data (June–December 2022) revealed noticeable shifts in approval and rejection of the federal government following major diplomatic events. Notably, Bolsonaro’s controversial address to foreign ambassadors in July coincided with the period when public approval surpassed rejection, suggesting a rallying effect.


- **Rhetorical Patterns in Speeches (H2):** Text analysis of Bolsonaro’s speeches at the UNGA and to ambassadors showed consistent use of nationalist, anti-globalist, and populist rhetoric. Frequently invoked terms like "freedom," "corruption," and "sovereignty" were framed to appeal to conservative values, rather than diplomatic goals.


- **Public Recall of Events (H3):** Wordclouds based on open-ended survey questions (P01 and P02) demonstrated that foreign policy actions—such as the ambassadorial meeting and Bolsonaro’s UNGA address—temporarily displaced domestic issues in public memory. This indicates that such events were salient and perceived as politically significant by the public.


- **Visual Outputs:** Figures and wordclouds included in this project illustrate public opinion dynamics, event-specific recall, and speech patterns. These visuals are referenced throughout the article and were essential in investigating the study’s hypotheses.




Interpretation:


The evidence suggests that Bolsonaro’s use of foreign policy served dual purposes: it reinforced alignment with his ideological base and diverted public attention toward controlled narratives during the electoral period. His administration blurred the lines between diplomacy and domestic campaigning, weaponizing foreign platforms to bolster his populist image.


This project contributes to the broader literature on democratic backsliding and foreign policy politicization by demonstrating how international engagements can be instrumentalized for electoral gain in polarized democracies.
