# Populism on the Global Stage: Jair Bolsonaro's Foreign Policy as a Mechanism of Electoral Appeal

This project aims to investigate how Jair Bolsonaro's foreign policy actions in 2022 may have influenced public opinion. It is based on weekly survey data from the Instituto de Pesquisa de Reputação e Imagem (IPRI), encompassing 30,000 responses from June to December 2022.

## Research Questions

(1) How did Brazilian public opinion vary during weeks marked by Bolsonaro’s key foreign policy actions in 2022?
(2) Was foreign policy instrumentalized by Bolsonaro as an electoral tool in a polarized environment?

## Project Structure

- `/data/clean`: Cleaned and unified dataset used for analysis (not yet uploaded).
- `/scripts/`: R scripts for data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and modeling (not yet uploaded).
- `/figures/`: Visual outputs, such as approval trends, wordclouds, and regression plots (not yet uploaded).
- `/output/`: Summary of main results and interpretations (not yet uploaded).

## Data Source

All raw data comes from the official open data repository of the Brazilian government:

## Notes

- Weeks 2 to 5 were excluded because they focused exclusively on regional-level samples, whereas the analysis is based on nationally representative weekly surveys to ensure comparability across time.

- Special-topic monthly surveys were also excluded, as they did not follow the same structure, timing, or thematic focus as the regular weekly rounds. Their inclusion could introduce inconsistencies and bias the temporal analysis of public opinion dynamics during 2022.
