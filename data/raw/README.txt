Instituto de Pesquisa de Reputação e Imagem (IPRI) – Raw Data

This ZIP archive contains the raw data files from weekly public opinion surveys conducted by IPRI (Instituto de Pesquisa de Reputação e Imagem) between June and December 2022.

The included datasets correspond to Week 1 and Weeks 6 to 29 only. Weeks 2 to 5 were excluded because they focused exclusively on regional samples and are not directly comparable to the national-level surveys used in this analysis. Monthly special-topic surveys were also excluded for the same reason.

The original files include weekly microdata, questionnaires, and variable dictionaries, all in their original format (.xlsx). No modifications have been made to these files.

All raw data is publicly available and was obtained through the Brazilian government's open data portal:

The cleaned and unified dataset used in this project can be found in `/data/clean/` for reproducibility purposes.
