\f0\fs24 \cf0 Instituto de Pesquisa de Reputa\'e7\'e3o e Imagem (IPRI) \'96 Raw Data\
\
This ZIP archive contains the raw data files from weekly public opinion surveys conducted by IPRI (Instituto de Pesquisa de Reputa\'e7\'e3o e Imagem) between June and December 2022.\
\
The included datasets correspond to Week 1 and Weeks 6 to 29 only. Weeks 2 to 5 were excluded because they focused exclusively on regional samples and are not directly comparable to the national-level surveys used in this analysis. Monthly special-topic surveys were also excluded for the same reason.\
\
The original files include weekly microdata, questionnaires, and variable dictionaries, all in their original format (.xlsx). No modifications have been made to these files.\
\
All raw data is publicly available and was obtained through the Brazilian government's open data portal:\

\
For reproducibility purposes, the cleaned and unified dataset used in this project can be found in `/data/clean/`.\
